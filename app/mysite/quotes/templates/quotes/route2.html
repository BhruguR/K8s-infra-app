<h1>You found ROUTE 2, here is some coffee!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, it means ingress has routed to route 2, there isn't much
  for you to do here either, so I leave you with another quote from Seneca:</p>

</p>"Who would deny it is hard? But it is human, you were born for this, 
     to suffer loss, to perish, to hope and to fear, to upset others and yourself, 
     to dread death and yet also desire it, and worst of all, 
     never to understand your true condition".</p>
